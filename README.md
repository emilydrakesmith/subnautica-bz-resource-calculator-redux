# Version Notes

### About Version Notes

The version history for this app will be organized in a four-digit **W.X.Y.Z** system.
* **W** denotes the main version of this app.  It will be zero until reaching MVP at which point it will become one.  Changes in this number denote a completely new version of the app.
* **X** denotes addition of refactoring of a major component of the app such as a new functionality or directory.
* **Y** denotes completion of a series of commits sufficient to consider a new feature or component working.
* **Z** denotes a minor change, a bugfix, or a commit that does not fully complete a new feature.
* Minor changes such as fixing indentation or spelling may not be given a new version number.

# Appendices

<a id='appendix-1'></a>

## Appendix 1: Boilerplate Content from create-react-app

**All content after this message until the next Appendix is boilerplate information populated by create-react-app when this project was initialized via npx.  Aside from some alterations to the heading formats I've left it as it was created.**

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
